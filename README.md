# YouTube Only Subscribed Comments

** This extension is not in the extension store, you have to clone the repo to install it. **

Hides YouTube comments for channels you are not subscribed to and adds a toggle to show/hide them at will.

Because [@somoso](https://github.com/somoso) requested it ðŸ˜€.

Uses `MutationObserver` to listen to the addition of `.comment-section-renderer-items` to `#watch-discussion`
because the comments section is only added to the DOM when it comes into the viewport.
